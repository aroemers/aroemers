### 👋 Hi, **Arnout** here

Currently freelance **Scala** programmer by day, **Clojure** programmer by night  
Though that has been the _other way around_ as well

My ❤️ for **Clojure** can be seen when looking at my repositories, such as

- [`mount-lite`](https://github.com/aroemers/mount-lite), my composable take on the `mount` library
- [`redelay`](https://github.com/aroemers/redelay), simple state management for Clojure projects
- [`crustimoney`](https://github.com/aroemers/crustimoney), my first open source library, recently rewritten to be a full featured PEG parser

Most of the code is written in **Emacs**, inside a **tmux** session (dotfiles [here](https://github.com/aroemers/.dotfiles)), on a [Keyboardio Model 100](https://shop.keyboard.io/collections/the-keyboardio-model-100/products/model-100), using the **Colemak** layout. With a good cup of drip ☕️.

Want to **hire me**? Go to the contact form at https://functionalbytes.nl.

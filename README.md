üëã Hi, **Arnout** here

Currently _freelance_ **Scala** programmar by day, **Clojure** programmer by night.  
Though that has been the _other way around_ as well

My ‚ù§Ô∏è for **Clojure** can be seen when looking at my repositories, such as

- [`mount-lite`](https://github.com/aroemers/mount-lite), my composable take on the `mount` library
- [`redelay`](https://github.com/aroemers/redelay), my simpler `mount`
- [`crustimoney`](https://github.com/aroemers/crustimoney), my first open source library, which is currently being [rewritten](https://github.com/aroemers/crustimoney/tree/v2) to be a full featured **PEG parser**

Want to hire me? Go to the contact form at https://functionalbytes.nl
